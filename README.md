# MvvmMonkey

MvvmMonkey is a low-overhead library that take a little bit of the boiler-plate (and pain) out of MVVM.

MvvmMonkey is not a framework, it's a collections of features you can pick and choose from, 
it's primary design goal is to have have minimal effect on the application using it.

Currently there's just one version of this library targeting WPF 4.5 (MvvmMonkey.Wpf), if there's demand I'll
port the library to the other XAML platforms (probably just to "Universal Windows App").

Compnents in this library:

Method Binding
---

Adding the '[TypeDescriptionProvider(typeof(MethodBinding))]' attribute to you view model class
will add "fake" ICommand properties for each method that accepts zero or one parameters

The command method should either return void or Task, if you return task ICommand.CanExecute will
return false until the task is complete - disabling the button and preventing the user from 
accedently clickign it again while waiting.

View Model:

    [TypeDescriptionProvider(typeof(MethodBinding))]
    class DemoSelectionViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public void MethodBindingDemo()
        {
            Child = new MethodBindingViewModel();
        }
    }

View: 

    <Button Command="{Binding MethodBindingDemo}">
        <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap" Text="Bind to method demo"/>
    </Button>


View Locator
---

The 'ViewLocator' control will automatically find the view for your view model
without any mapping (if your view model ends with "ViewModel" your view has the same name but ends with "View"
and they are both in the same assembly)

View Model:

    [TypeDescriptionProvider(typeof(MethodBinding))]
    class DemoSelectionViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public void MethodBindingDemo()
        {
            Child = new MethodBindingViewModel();
        }
    }

View: 

	<mvvm:ViewLocator DataContext="{Binding Child}"/>

Notify Property Changed
---

I don't know a way to get rid of all the boiler plate of INotifyPropertyChanged but I can 
write the OnPropertyChanged method - and, in the spirit of MvvmMonkey, you don't need to 
change you class heirarcy to use it

    private object _child;
    public object Child
    {
        get { return _child; }
        set
        {
            if(_child!=value)
            {
                _child = value;
                PropertyChange.Notify(this, PropertyChanged);
            }
        }
    }
